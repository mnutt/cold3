bridges from the library, maybe:

cloud.js - all calls to fetch from our server code to third party apis
database.js - everything supabase, these two should work both places
amazon.js - everything that uses the node amazon modules

and so icarus probably can't cover tests that call amazon

/*
summary note about Nuxt/Serverless, and useFetch(), $fetch(), and fetch()
here, because we're deep in the library, you're using fetch instead of Nuxt's $fetch
and thus need to add content type header and stringify the body

a nuxt component calling down to a nuxt api handler should use $fetch
a nuxt api handler can use $fetch
code that fetches that might be called by nuxt or serverless must use fetch

so then there's useFetch and $fetch
only use useFetch when you want hydration
which for 1.0 might be never!
after that may be just for info graph cards and then search engine optimization
useFetch is complicated because it returns already reactive variables

//here also is where you deal with, what if the api takes forever
//you need to return a toolong
//and then much later if it does come back, log that you gave up, but the api did do something
//it's cool that you've figured out this design for fetch.js to be the place wehre you handle all of this
//also, there should be like a datadog endpoing which is just a critical and emergency report to developers
//and that's where all this stuff goes--not api failure, but our own code failure
//and very slow apis that meant the code here imagined the other side never got back to us, but then did!

//also, let's say it just never never gets back--does cloudflare stop the worker at some point?


/*
A note on fetch, exceptions, catch and throw, JSON parsing and stringification, and controlling what we can.

Exceptions from errors in our own code propagate upwards to be caught and logged at a higher level.
For example, JSON.stringify throws if it encounters a circular reference or a BigInt property.
But this is (1) highly unlikely and (2) indicates a serious error in our code.
So these exceptions are thrown up to be logged for us to fix.

Conversely, these functions are designed so that no matter how external APIs behave, they *cannot* throw up.
All issues related to API behavior and response are caught and returned as part of the result object, allowing the caller to handle them appropriately.
Unlike the coding errors mentioned earlier, these API-related issues are both (1) quite likely and (2) completely beyond our control.
The calling code will detect these issues, log them, and can implement round-robin failover to avoid relying on an API which was working great for weeks, and suddenly becomes problematic.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

what if the server takes forever, you give up, and then it reports having done something

this function performs these steps:

-remove redundant clutter from common objects
-measure the byte size of the payload we're logging to datadog, which leads to monetary cost

-searching for key names across the whole tree
-searching through resulting text to blank out potentiall problem areas

more thinking about redact
it's a difficult problem
you can't actually prune the tree, because those are the real objects! you need to use them, still!
if you blank out an api key, well, you did it in the real copy

ok, so you could stringify, then parse to make a copy, redact that, then stringify again
this probably works? but then there's the look version, ugh

so the look version can't be parsed
even if you could parse it, the type information would be lost--json stringify, parse turns everything into a regular object, there's no instanceof anymore

also, some of what you're trying to redace you know exactly what the value is
other stuff that you're trying to redact you know what the property name is

if you affect the whole

so this is what you came up with, but absolutely table this for far later, probably after v1
deal with the body text
you're going to redact it
but have to be careful, because it still needs to be json parsed by datadog

sort characters as follows:
letters, numbers, +.@, those are word charcters
everything else, those are format characters
you're not splitting, exactly, rather you're dividing into alternating strings of word/format/word/format
and then you scan through teh whole thing


well, this  may actually not be too hard, and may actually work
ask chat how json stringify works
oh no it's not going to work because of escaped characters, ugh
ok, yeah, it's hard

two different strategies
(1) for the look string
split into lines
for each line, parse out the key and the value
redact values based on value
redact values based on key
form back into lines, keeping the indent and last part

(2) for the stringified body
unstringify the body, copying it, eliminating types, undoing escaping
go through all the key-value pairs, looking at keys and redacting values
and looking just at values and redacting them
restringify the redacted copy

third design
you bake this feature into look and stringify
you already have both custom wrapped
and that way, you never have to parse anything
keys are always text, and you only need to scrutinize 
stringify already has key and value
you'll have to add that to look

this also gets ahead of the "too long <999> thing in look
weren't you going to put an ellipsis on there, actually?
[]like do ellipsis character, actually



here's a cheap/easy solution for right now
there are only a few 


for right now it's pretty easy
