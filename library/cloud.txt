bridges from the library, maybe:

cloud.js - all calls to fetch from our server code to third party apis
database.js - everything supabase, these two should work both places
amazon.js - everything that uses the node amazon modules

and so icarus probably can't cover tests that call amazon
but that's what $ node test.js is for?

/*
summary note about Nuxt/Serverless, and useFetch(), $fetch(), and fetch()
here, because we're deep in the library, you're using fetch instead of Nuxt's $fetch
and thus need to add content type header and stringify the body

a nuxt component calling down to a nuxt api handler should use $fetch
a nuxt api handler can use $fetch
code that fetches that might be called by nuxt or serverless must use fetch

so then there's useFetch and $fetch
only use useFetch when you want hydration
which for 1.0 might be never!
after that may be just for info graph cards and then search engine optimization
useFetch is complicated because it returns already reactive variables
*/












//here also is where you deal with, what if the api takes forever
//you need to return a toolong
//and then much later if it does come back, log that you gave up, but the api did do something
//it's cool that you've figured out this design for fetch.js to be the place wehre you handle all of this
//also, there should be like a datadog endpoing which is just a critical and emergency report to developers
//and that's where all this stuff goes--not api failure, but our own code failure
//and very slow apis that meant the code here imagined the other side never got back to us, but then did!

//also, let's say it just never never gets back--does cloudflare stop the worker at some point?


/*
A note on fetch, exceptions, catch and throw, JSON parsing and stringification, and controlling what we can.

Exceptions from errors in our own code propagate upwards to be caught and logged at a higher level.
For example, JSON.stringify throws if it encounters a circular reference or a BigInt property.
But this is (1) highly unlikely and (2) indicates a serious error in our code.
So these exceptions are thrown up to be logged for us to fix.

Conversely, these functions are designed so that no matter how external APIs behave, they *cannot* throw up.
All issues related to API behavior and response are caught and returned as part of the result object, allowing the caller to handle them appropriately.
Unlike the coding errors mentioned earlier, these API-related issues are both (1) quite likely and (2) completely beyond our control.
The calling code will detect these issues, log them, and can implement round-robin failover to avoid relying on an API which was working great for weeks, and suddenly becomes problematic.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

/*
what if you don't want to wait for the body
what if you dont' want to wait at all--ignore any response, and return as quickly as possible
what if the server takes forever, you give up, and then it reports having done something
what if the response isn't in json--there's probably a response header and you should only parse after checking it!
