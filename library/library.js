this will be the pass through imports library
so you can move a function from library1 to library2 without changing a bunch of imports in code files

you might also bring in database, cloud, and door functions here

and also this is where you channel sticker.js
but ping files still import sticker.js by itself to be really lean

/*
// File: moduleA.js
export const valueA = 'Hello';

// File: moduleB.js
export { valueA } from './moduleA';

// Now you can import valueA from moduleB.js:
import { valueA } from './moduleB';
