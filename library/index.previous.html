todo

this requires serve, unfortunately
but maybe with serve you could get auto reload working

also, notes on getting library functions working in both modern and vintage environments:

import * as allExports from './library.js';
// Reflect on the imported module
console.log(Object.keys(allExports));

you could probably loop to pin them all to global from there

to get file:// to work, you have to not use script type module
code in the library can tell if it's being loaded as a module or not

if (typeof exports === 'undefined' && typeof window !== 'undefined' && this === undefined) {
	console.log('This script is running as an ES6 module.');
} else {
	console.log('This script is running as a traditional script.');
}
