~ security note ~

good security design is always a balance between security and usability

the goal is to keep the user signed in without expiration
and to keep that as secure as possible

this is not the current experience of the web, a short timeout, any IP address change, or any use from another device leads to automatic sign-out
and the poor user experience harms security, as users choose bad passwords, or discontinue using the site altogether

the only place i've noticed signin without expiration is facebook
i use facebook less than once a year, but whenever i go to facebook.com, im still signed in
meta likely has metrics that link signing out a user with losing that user

essentially, a browser is identified by a tag
and if a signed-in browser reports the same tag to the server, it's still signed in
but there are two security enhancements:

(1) scary naming
in local storage, the key and name look like this:
current_session_password: account_access_code_DO_NOT_SHARE_hi1y5ICjnEQLVDKtawm0C
imagine a n00b user is on a discord server or subreddit dedicated to power users of an instance of the platform, where a sophisticated attacker coaches users into compromising their accounts
warning language to the n00b may give them pause

(2) browser tag hashed, not sent
the browser tag is never sent to the server
the hash is never saved to the disk
if the user's disk or system is compromised, a rudimentary scanner can recover the browser tag, but must compute the hash

(3) hash is of tag and fingerprint
rather than hashing the tag alone, details specific to the browser are included in the data hashed
these details are designed to be specific to the user's device, but unlikely to change

7ms

concerns with fingerprinting and identifying the session:

pinia, shouldn't browserTag live there?

how long does this take? (7-10ms on your big windows desktop, measure on your phone)
you'll include it in every single API call, as it identifies who the caller at least says they are
you don't want it to slow down the very first page laod for the user
you can cache it for the whole session--in a global? in pinia?
you can't save it to local storage! or let pinia do this unknowingly!
you need to only await for it on the very first API call, not at the start of the first page load

environment detection exploration
a library function might be called by:
-a lambda function running node, either simulated locally by Serverless Framework or deployed to AWS Lambda

-a web browser, like the user's real browser running on their device, with a page
