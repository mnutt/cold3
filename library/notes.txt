[x]string clip to parse
[x]string validation, like only alphanumeric, regex from chatgpt
[x]randbetween, inclusive, just in case you need it
[x]ticks to nice text for the user in the current time zone, see if you can avoid a library actually--yes, you can avoid a library and do all the internationalization you need, and very succinctly
[x]say four digit byte size, don't otherwise internationalize numbers

[x]browser crypto, symmetric and asymetric, []hashing
[~]uri encoding, get taht in here just for compleness, have tests that show one+space or one%20space
[]email validation, another one for chatgpt, 1raw, 2cleaned for use, 3normalized for duplicate detection

do all the text checking you need for the database
and for validating single-line user input, like a screen name
not, at this time, the text checking for a user writing a comment

you want to use tag and now as local variables in code
but they're clashing with tag() and now() as short commonly imported functions

you were thinking makeTag(), but tickNow() is not awesome
maybe Tag() and Now()

once you've figured out pinia, you might code the sorted record thing
allows immediate lookups by tag
and also browsing in tick count order
keeps sorted
fast for adding already sorted input data
doesn't readmit duplicates, which will be super common
or maybe pinia already has something better
or maybe this isn't the right way to do things

/*

2014may17 hopefully good thinking on finishing off this bike shed

inspect
if you want to inspect an object directly, and y ou know you're in the browser inspector, just use console.log directly
your function inspect() is new, replaces lots of old stuff, and works like this
doesn't log anything, always returns a string
string is always indented, never tries to be single line
doesn't return a tick count, obviously
better than json stringify and node util inspect, actually gets the functions and stuff those miss
always indents by two spaces
goes deep, stopping at 2k of text output
uses 7 number, true boolean, "string", [array], {object}, function()
if you want to see the name of an object, you have to wrap like inspect({object})
test with exception objects
you're going to use inspect to see what third party rest apis are telling your worker

log
starts with timestamp and tilde
logs to record and console.log
turns everything into text, always, using say
keeps everything on one line, always
doesn't call inspect, ever--you have to call that manually

say
turns directly into text, succicently--inspect is the verbose and deep one







*/
















/*
2024may16
dustiest corner of the bike shed
make sure your log and see plan is good before you go back in there
-get rid of log destinations
-do program an indented deep object sayer
-dont use it when there's a browser inspector which has arrows




*/




/*
more bikeshedding here, but what if log worked like this
log(a)
turns a into text, and prefixes it with the timestamp
log(a, b)
not sure anymore
the thing you forgot when designing this refactor above was that in the browser, you don't want everything text, because the browser inspector has arrows to go deep into nested objects, which you won't code yourself, and which is incredible




*/


/*
moar notes and ideas

instead of see doing lines like
(string) s "hello"
all you need is "hello" because quotes mean string
{object}
[array]
"string"
7 with no punctuation is a number
true with no punctuation is a boolean


you made the separte vite entry point
but now nuxt localhost:3000/test is working so well you don't need it(?)
like, it's just as fast
and you can Ctrl+S library0.js several times in a row and it refreshes each time
and, the text stays in place on the page, and also scrolls down in the console
so, what more is there to do here?
i guess refactor it so you don't have log destinations anymore

/*
todo, javascript is so wonky it's hard to make a see that lets you easily look inside
here are some possible improvements
get things on multiple lines and indent them 2 spaces
there's lots of:

ok (boolean) true
n (number) 7
responseText (string) ""
clone (function) undefined
o (object) {message (string) "hello"...}
a (array) [1,2,3]

shorten this so it's just:

ok: true,
n: 7,
responseText: "",
clone(),
o {
	message: "hello"
	...
},
a [1,2,3]

because json stringify skips functions, you'll probably have to write your own recursive walker and indenter
and that's fine, go three levels deep by default

moar notes for your return to this bike shed:

remove look(o), instead you have to call log(see(o))

remove the multiple loggers feature
you want icarus, but will do that later as a separate system
that system will have auto refresh
in-place traffic lights
and an in-place log that is maybe icarus()

you just remembered that log shouldn't turn everything into a string
doing so breaks the inspector's > arrow
this may also be why earlier log didn't tickstamp
if log gets a single string, do it all on one line
if log gets a single non-string, or multiple anything, call console.log multiple times for multiple lines
*/








do encoding at the same time as you do cryptography
maybe make a little object so you dont have to type Uint8array over and over again
the object is indelible
holds some binary data
and has methods to convert between all these different formats:

text, like a string of cleartext
length, how long is it in bytes when you look at it as bytes
base16
base64, checking roundtrips and whatnot

you create these from:
text strings
base16
base64
random data, cryptographically secure

following hte model, this should be tiny, it shouldn't be your node project's Data object



remind yourself of the pattern, but you think you remember it
and now you can use const!

export function Data(c) {
	const o = {}
	o.type = 'Data'//no how do you make that const?
	const type 
	

	const function fromText(s) {

	}

	const function base16()
	const function text()

	return o
}
this constructor makes a new data object

have it lazily create and then save the different forms
understand how utf8 text encoding plays a role with all this, bake that into Data as the default









server logs
dog() and log() goes to datadog
or, figure out your pattern for an api function
with a total covereage try catch
and then maybe if there's an error, inspect it into text and send it back to the browser
and even use status codes, maybe--ask chatgpt
first just see if you can get a stack trace from a worker
but then you have to make sure this isn't an attack vector, you have to know if you're built for production or not

the api full catch also dogs if it takes longer than 2s

a little clock appears in the page at 2s indicating (clock) working 2s...

dog is great because it's secure and private even in deployment--if the attacker figures out how to break an api, they can't get information mistakingly included in a log

duh the workign clock can totally be completely client-side
ask chatgpt if there's a convention in nuxt to guard against repeat requests to the same api
the don't click or you'll mess up your order, thing

ask chatgpt about the confirm form resubmission browser warning
you don't think you're coding any forms that could cause this, but understand it for the first time ever to be sure

have icarus have a little expandable text box where you can live type into a function to test it



idea for how to get dates the fastest
worst, by the way, is putting up a calendar clicker for today, asking for a dob
phone puts up number pad
instruction text says birthday, YYYYMMDD
see if you can infer other orders, including shorter orders like 040176
if they type YYMMDD, YYYYDDMM
one or two buttons pop up that say "do you mean 2002 Jan 26"

== moar web security, CORS

net23 apis will check the origin header right in the lambda node code
you should also make cold3.cc/api apis only talk to cold3.cc and net23 on https
you could check origin in code, but a more standard way is to implement the CORS preflight thing
and a standard way to do that is:
https://nuxt-security.vercel.app/documentation/middleware/cors-handler
"Testing CORS configuration can be done by running one application with NuxtSecurity enabled and creating a second application (that is running on a different port) that will send a request to the first app. Then, a CORS error could be easily observed that proves that CORS is working as expected."

if you've got things all CORS-ed up, can you still develop on localhost?






== moar web security, CSP

chatgpt suggests:

<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'">
</head>

but not sure what this prevents. not injecting script directly into the page through inspector, but maybe a chrome extension running script?
also not sure what adding this could break
