2014may17 hopefully good thinking on finishing off this bike shed

inspect
if you want to inspect an object directly, and y ou know you're in the browser inspector, just use console.log directly
your function inspect() is new, replaces lots of old stuff, and works like this
doesn't log anything, always returns a string
string is always indented, never tries to be single line
doesn't return a tick count, obviously
better than json stringify and node util inspect, actually gets the functions and stuff those miss
always indents by two spaces
goes deep, stopping at 2k of text output
uses 7 number, true boolean, "string", [array], {object}, function()
if you want to see the name of an object, you have to wrap like inspect({object})
test with exception objects
you're going to use inspect to see what third party rest apis are telling your worker

log
starts with timestamp and tilde
logs to record and console.log
turns everything into text, always, using say
keeps everything on one line, always
doesn't call inspect, ever--you have to call that manually

say
turns directly into text, succicently--inspect is the verbose and deep one

dustiest corner of the bike shed
make sure your log and see plan is good before you go back in there
-get rid of log destinations
-do program an indented deep object sayer
-dont use it when there's a browser inspector which has arrows




*/




/*
more bikeshedding here, but what if log worked like this
log(a)
turns a into text, and prefixes it with the timestamp
log(a, b)
not sure anymore
the thing you forgot when designing this refactor above was that in the browser, you don't want everything text, because the browser inspector has arrows to go deep into nested objects, which you won't code yourself, and which is incredible

/*
moar notes and ideas

instead of see doing lines like
(string) s "hello"
all you need is "hello" because quotes mean string
{object}
[array]
"string"
7 with no punctuation is a number
true with no punctuation is a boolean


you made the separte vite entry point
but now nuxt localhost:3000/test is working so well you don't need it(?)
like, it's just as fast
and you can Ctrl+S library0.js several times in a row and it refreshes each time
and, the text stays in place on the page, and also scrolls down in the console
so, what more is there to do here?
i guess refactor it so you don't have log destinations anymore

/*
TODO
see is too confusing; your planned replacement will be called inspect
so then the core functions are log, say, and inspect

/*
todo, javascript is so wonky it's hard to make a see that lets you easily look inside
here are some possible improvements
get things on multiple lines and indent them 2 spaces
there's lots of:

ok (boolean) true
n (number) 7
responseText (string) ""
clone (function) undefined
o (object) {message (string) "hello"...}
a (array) [1,2,3]

shorten this so it's just:

ok: true,
n: 7,
responseText: "",
clone(),
o {
	message: "hello"
	...
},
a [1,2,3]

because json stringify skips functions, you'll probably have to write your own recursive walker and indenter
and that's fine, go three levels deep by default

moar notes for your return to this bike shed:

remove look(o), instead you have to call log(see(o))

remove the multiple loggers feature
you want icarus, but will do that later as a separate system
that system will have auto refresh
in-place traffic lights
and an in-place log that is maybe icarus()

you just remembered that log shouldn't turn everything into a string
doing so breaks the inspector's > arrow
this may also be why earlier log didn't tickstamp
if log gets a single string, do it all on one line
if log gets a single non-string, or multiple anything, call console.log multiple times for multiple lines
