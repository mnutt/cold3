/*
... to begin, a brief essay about logs and logging. ahem... .....
.................................................................
... log('note', s1, o2) .........................................
.................................................................
log is our wrapper on console.log, which adds the time and works with icarus
use with look() to see into objects with types, values, and structure
when you're done with code, log calls should already be removed
.................................................................
... dog('note', s1, o2) ........................... [DEBUG] .....
.................................................................
dog is like log, but it goes to datadog, too
also just for development, this is if you want to see what code is doing that's deployed
in datadog, dog logs are tagged debug
.................................................................
... logAudit('title', {w1, w2}) ................... [AUDIT] .....
.................................................................
we want to keep an audit trail of every use of every third-party api
for instance, did we try to send this email? charge this credit card? how did the api respond?
audit logs get saved in datadog both from local and cloud deployed code, because the use of the api was real
.................................................................
... logAlert('title', {e, w1, w2}) ................ [ALERT] .....
.................................................................
in every entrypoint where your code starts running, have a try block that catches and sends to alert
this means that a mistake you didn't intend, a truly exceptional circumstance, has otherwise gone uncaught
in deployed cloud code only, alert logs to to datadog; from there they should wake up the fellow on pager duty!
.................................................................
... ROBIN .......................................................
.................................................................
not here but related is the round robin system of api use
functions will record duration and success of higher level user tasks, like entering a code in a text message
robin won't use datadog, but rather two tables in postgres
.................................................................
... RUM .........................................................
.................................................................
so all that's great, but is the real experience of real users on the site fast?
for that, we'll incorporate real user monitoring, probably datadog's product, which is separate from logs
the run script on client side pages communicates with their back end, and makes nice charts for us to review
.................................................................
... the end .....................................................

fetch() is from the browser, plain vanilla and what all the rest ultimately call down to
$fetch() is from nuxt, use in page and api code, server and client, but not lambda, obeys middleware and parses for you
useFetch() is from nuxt, use in page code, does hybrid rendering
ashFetchum() is your own, parses, measures duration, and catches errors

let r = ashFetchum(  takes...
	c,  [c]all parameters, everything you used to prepare the request
	q)  re[q]uest details, what ash will use to call fetch
r: {                 ...and returns c and q unchanged other than filling in q.tick, and:
	c,
	q,
	p   res[p]onse details, everything that happened as a result of the request
}

[c]all:
c might have details like c.name, c.email, c.phoneNumber which you prepared into q.body

re[q]uest:
q.resource is the url like https://example.com
q.method is GET or POST
q.headers is an object of keys and values for fetch
q.body is already stringified body text, raw and ready for fetch

time:
q.tick is when we made the request
p.tick is when we finished reading the response
p.duration is how long that took

res[p]onse:
p.success is true if everything looks good as far as ash can tell
p.response is what fetch returned
p.bodyText is raw from the wire
p.body is what we tried to parse that into
p.error is an exception if thrown

/*
additional fancy features ash can't do yet, but you could add later:
(1) use axios, which keeps coming up in stackoverflow and chatgpt, and can do timeouts
fetch is working just fine, but can 52 million weekly npm downloads all be wrong? "Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
(2) set a give up timeout, using AbortController, setTimeout, and clearTimeout, or just axios
adding this and setting to like 4 seconds will keep a misbehaving API frm making the user wait
but also, workers only live 30 seconds max, and you've set lambda to the same, so that should also govern here
(3) have a fire and forget option, to not wait for the body to arrive, or not wait at all
you tried this and immediately logs were unreliable because cloudflare and amazon were tearing down early
the way to do this in a worker is event.waitUntil(p), which looks well designed
you don't think there's a way to do this in lambda, so instead you Promise.all() to delay sending the response
with that, workers are faster, lambdas the same, well maybe faster because now the fetches can run in parallel
but there's a code benefit: you could call dog() and logAudit() without having to await them
