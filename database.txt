SQL statements fed into Supabase to create the database tables.
Here in text notes; it would be better if they were tracked in git some other way!

CREATE TABLE table_settings (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE table_counts (
  identifier CHAR(21) PRIMARY KEY,
  count BIGINT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL
);
