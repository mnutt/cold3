Icarus is a vite little tdd system and test runner for the library functions

commands you used to make this:

https://vitejs.dev/guide/
$ npm create vite@latest
chose vue, rather than vanilla or react
chose javascript, rather than customize with create-vue or nuxt
$ cd hivite
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
http://localhost:5173

commands to use icarus:

$ cd icarus
$ npm run icarus
http://localhost:5173

it works! superfast refresh on:
-not just this folder, but the library folder alongside
-not just code changes, but comment and whitespace changes

next steps for this bike shed:
[]get the test results on the page
[]get the log output on the page
refresh replaces those there, instead of scrolling forever downwards
and if that works, can you not open the dev tools until you want to walk an object with >

[]move these notes up into cold3 readme
