notes

commands to create and run:

https://vitejs.dev/guide/
$ npm create vite@latest
chose vue, rather than vanilla or react
chose javascript, rather than customize with create-vue or nuxt
$ cd hivite
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
http://localhost:5173


to use
$ cd icarus
$ npm run icarus
http://localhost:5173

and, it's working, refreshing on
-not just this folder, but the library folder alongside
-not just code changes, but comment and whitespace changes
now just integrate this into cold3



icarus is a vite little test runner for libraryX.js

here's what's next for this bike shed
[]get the test results on the page
[]get the log output on the page
refresh replaces those there, instead of scrolling forever downwards
and if that works, can you not open the dev tools until you want to walk an object with >
