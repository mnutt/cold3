/*
here's the easiest way to test email and sms, you now realize
place serverless, nuxt, icarus, all that, aside
place deploying each time and getting logs to logflare
place hooking up buttons to fetch to the worker to fetch to the lambda
all that, you don't need it

just go all the way back to node
$ node test.js

and then omg there's no live reload, there's no web browser
and you immediately get all the console output
and once things are working that way, they'll very likely work no problem beyond
*/

/*
maybe split out
$ node test
$ node snippet
$ node seal

and also get them into package.json so it's npm run test, npm run snippet, npm run seal
snippet probably also runs tests, maybe

i guess the other fancy wiring you could do is make it so deploy shrinkwraps and commits, or checks that you did
